            Hi! My name is Hamida Mohamed a computer science student at UMSL. I choose computer sciecne beacuse I love being able to create <br>
            applications from scratch using critical and creative skills. I enjoy learning about quantum computing and web development, however <br>
            would love to learn more. I have used languages like C++ and Java in the past. I am excited to embark on this experince to learn and create <br>
            long lasting memories.

            I have a huge beautiful family! I am the third oldest of nine siblings. My siblings were born in America. My two older siblings born in the heart of California, <br>
            while the rest of us were born here in St. Louis. My dad was born on the boarder of Ethipia, while my mom is from Kenya a place I call my second home. <br>
            My family and I moved to Kenya for two years an experince I would never forget. I learned a lot about the culture and enviroment my mother grew up in. <br>
            I had the ability to learn a new language and got close with more family members. To think a few years ago I would'nt have been able to communicate with them <br>
            and now we speak everyday is crazy to me!
